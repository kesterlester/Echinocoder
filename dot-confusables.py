We work with (multu)sets of $n$ vectors in $k$-dimensions.

Encoding dots are done with $m$ directions: $D=\{\vec d_1, \vec d_2, ... , \vec d_m\}$

There are $M$ vectors ($M=ceil(m/(k-1)$) which are orthogonal to the vectors in $D$ (these are the $M$ bad-bats): $B=\{\vec q_1, \vec q_2, \cdots, \vec q_M\}$. E.g. $\vec q_1 \cdot m_i = 0$ for all $i\in \{ 1, 2, \cdots, k-1 \}$.

The (multi)sets $E$ and $O$ have even and odd sums of the elements of $B$:

$E=\{ \vec 0, \vec q_1 + \vec q_2, \cdots \}$
$O=\{  \vec q_1, \vec q_2, \cdots, \vec q_2 + \vec q_5 + \vec q_9, \cdots \}$

We can represent elements of E and O (and their later trimmed version) by a set of dimension-M vectors (one for each free parameter) whose components show us how much of each cpt is to be used.

E.g. if the coefficients are lambda_1, lambda_2, ... \lambda_M which are buried inside each of the q_i .... i.e.:

     \vec q_1 = \lambda_1(parameter_1) \vec Q_1
     \vec q_2 = \lambda_2(parameter_4) \vec Q_2
     \vec q_3 = \lambda_3(parameter 1) \vec Q_3
     \vec q_4 = \lambda_4(parameter 1) \vec Q_4
     \vec q_5 = \lambda_5(parameter 2) \vec Q_5
     \vdots

then the vector

    5 q_1 + 2 q_2 + 3 q_3 - 8 q_4 + 9 q_5

would be represented by

    v_{param 1} = [  5,  0,  3, -8,  0, ... ]
    v_{param 2} = [  0,  0,  0,  0,  9, ... ]
    v_{param 3} = [  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, ... ]
    v_{param 4} = [  0,  2,  0,  0,  0, ... ]
    v_{param 5} = [  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, ... ]
    \vdots

which we could put into a matrix V_{ij}, with index i being the parameter, and index j being the occurrence count of vec q_j.

With such a format in mind, we could identify whether two different linear combinations(A and B) could be made equal by checking whether their difference (A-B) has at least k+1 non-zero rows ... and in that case
