Sobol Sampling
------------------------
Generates m k-dimensional unit vectors in the positive orthant using the 
Sobol low-discrepancy sequence.

If m is a power of 2, it uses Sobol's well balanced random_base2 method. 

Else: 
    sample = std: uses STANDARD sobol random(m) method, which may reduce balance
    sample = rr: uses random_base2 method to generate 2^q â‰¥ m vectors,
                 then RANDOMLY REMOVES excess vectors to obtain exactly m.
        
We need the unit vectors to be spaced out on the unit sphere, not the positive
orthant: 
      spread = lin: uses a LINEAR function 2 * vectors - 1. Bias towards 
                    (hyper)cube corners
      spread = gauss: uses a GAUSSIAN function. Hypothesised less bias.
