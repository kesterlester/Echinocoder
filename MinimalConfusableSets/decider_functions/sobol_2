Sobol Sampling Option 2
------------------------
Generates n k-dimensional unit vectors using the Sobol low-discrepancy sequence.
Always uses Sobol's random_base2 method to generate 2^m â‰¥ n vectors,
then randomly removes excess vectors to obtain exactly n.
This might achieve better uniformity compared to falling back to random(n) as in sobol_1.
